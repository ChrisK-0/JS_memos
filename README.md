### Why

Wanted to make a knowledge base for JS related mechanics. Good things to know or to remind oneself or perhaps find things you didn't know existed.

This is purely for myself, but I keep this repo public.

### Use

Drag the html file from a directory you are testing to your browser. JS files with the same name as the html file are connected. When changing JS files, refresh the html file tab you have it open in.

Check your browser's console for outputs.

### Refrencing

If an online course was used or I just saw this on the internet, the corresponding refrence is included in a comment. Code without refrence comments are something I've personally picked up and cannot refrence.
